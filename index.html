        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hello! My name is Mason Teal. I am 19 years old and in Interactive media design level 1. I was born in Ottawa Ontario and have lived here my whole life. My hobbies are: Gaming, Collecting Audiofile technology, Collecting Skylanders and Creating custom Gamecube Controllers. Did you know that there are some skylanders that are valued at over 800 dollars.</p>


        <p>Did you know that there are many different aspects to making audio sound good. IT'S TRUE! It’s not just the quality of the audio equipment, but also on the software end as well. There are many different file types for audio, some file types are compressed to keep file size small like: mp3. Mp3 isn’t that good despite being the most mainstream format. You can tell an audio file's quality by the Kilobits per second, mp3’s cap out at 320 kb/s which is actually decent except most mp3 the average person will encounter is 286 kb/s or less, that’s no good. The only streaming service to offer 320 kb/s is Apple music, so your selection is limited. That’s the reason music sounds like grit when turned up really loud. Other formats such as FLAC or WAV usually have a kilobit rate of 900 or higher. That’s much higher quality and a much better way to experience music, however, They are some of the largest file formats for music to be in. WAV is the biggest audio format, usually taking up 40 megabytes per file at the least. FLAC is slightly smaller and what I recommend. There are OGG files as well which are the smallest audio file format, but somehow have kilobit rates that go into the thousands. OGG files do this by stripping away all the extra data from the file like: album art, album title, artist and other minor file descriptors. Only use OGG if you know how to organize your files, however, they are very high quality. Next time you wonder why you music sounds thin or poorly recorded. It’s probably just a bad file. And that’s just the file side of things</p>
